# Program4: Word Counting using Binary Search Trees
 This program will be used to calculate the number of unique words from a given input, such as a regular text file,
 and it will store this within a Binary Search Tree.

## Instructions 

There are two ways to use this program. One is passing in a text file through the command line, through an example
command such as: "./a.exe < input.txt". This command will directly pass in a text file into the cin of the program,
which the program will then read character by character and output the list of unique words. The second way is to just
compile the program like normal and type a normal sentence in the console, making sure to press "ctrl+z" after being 
done with your desired sentence. Both of these will allow for the program to read the input correctly and hopefully 
have the correct answer.
